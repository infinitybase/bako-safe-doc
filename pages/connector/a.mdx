## What is connector?

The Connector serves as an essential interface for communicating with BSAFE from any other dApp that integrates this feature. It enables authentication within the BSAFE ecosystem and facilitates the creation of practical and secure multisig transactions. By utilizing the Connector, users gain access to a direct and reliable connection, ensuring an efficient and protected experience when conducting operations within the BSAFE environment.

## How does it work?

The Connector harnesses the connector features provided by
[Fuel Wallet](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-wallet),
offering dApps an interface through a global context to communicate with the Fuel Wallet.
By utilizing this connector, we've implemented custom methods enabling direct communication
between this wallet and the BSAFE ecosystem.
