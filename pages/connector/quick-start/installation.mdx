1. **Clone the repository**

   In this walkthrough we are going to use a React template with TypeScript and Chakra UI.

   ```tsx
    git clone https://github.com/infinitybase/bako-safe-dapp
   ```

1. **Install dependencies**

   - fuels@0.76.12: the fuels SDK for TypeScript
   - bako-safe@0.0.51: the Bako Safe SDK for interacting with resources
   - @fuel-wallet/react@0.15.2: the fuels wallet for React
   - @fuel-wallet/sdk@0.15.2: the fuels wallet SDK
   - @fuels/react@0.15.3: the fuels SDK for React

   ```tsx
   cd bako-safe-dapp &&
   yarn &&
   ```

1. **Understanding our project**

   In the file **`src/App.tsx`**, we add the Fuel provider with the Bako Safe connector.

   ```tsx
   import React from 'react'
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
   import App from './App.tsx'
   import { FuelProvider } from '@fuel-wallet/react'
   import { BSafeConnector } from 'bsafe'
   import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'
   import { defaultTheme } from './themes/default.ts'

   const bsafe = new BSafeConnector()

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <FuelProvider
         theme={'dark'}
         fuelConfig={{
           connectors: [bsafe],
           storage: null,
         }}
       >
         <ChakraProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
           <App />
         </ChakraProvider>
       </FuelProvider>
     </React.StrictMode>
   )
   ```

   By wrapping our application with the Fuel provider, we gain access to various hooks that facilitate interaction with the fuel wallet:

   ```tsx
   const { fuel } = useFuel()
   const { account } = useAccount()
   const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()
   const { isConnected } = useIsConnected()
   const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure()
   ```

   In addition to the hooks from the example, several more can be explored via the link.

1. **Creating a Transaction**

   When the user connects to the fuel wallet, they select a predicate previously created in the Bako Safe app. From there, the user can create transactions for that predicate and send them:

   ```tsx
   async function handleTransfer() {
     if (!account) return
     const amount = bn.parseUnits(amountInput) ?? bn(1_000)

     const provider = await FuelWalletProvider.create(BSafe.get('PROVIDER'))

     const wallet = await fuel.getWallet(account, provider)

     const result = await wallet.transfer(Address.fromString(addressInput), amount, BaseAssetId, {
       gasPrice: BSafe.get('GAS_PRICE'),
       gasLimit: BSafe.get('GAS_LIMIT'),
     })

     const { id, status } = await result.waitForResult()
     console.log('result: ', { id, status })
   }
   ```

   Transactions are not immediately broadcast to the network; instead, they are sent to the Bako Safe servers and wait for the vault subscribers who generated the transaction to sign it. Once all signature requirements are met, the transaction is broadcast to the network.

1. **Calling a Contract**

   The contract call operates similarly to a transaction. We use the vault again as a wallet and, having access to the contract's ABI generated earlier, call the contract's methods. Initially, create a simple contract to interact with Bako Safe:

   1. Create a folder named **`sway`**.
   2. Inside it, create a file **`src/main.sw`**:

      ```tsx
      contract;
      use std::logging::log;
      abi MyContract {
          fn return_true(val1: u64) -> u64;
      }
      impl MyContract for Contract {
          fn return_true(val1: u64) -> u64 {
              log(val1);
              val1
          }
      }
      ```

   3. Add the file **`Forc.lock`**:

      ```tsx
      ;[[package]]
      name = 'MyContract'
      source = 'member'
      dependencies = ['std'][[package]]
      name = 'core'
      source = 'path+from-root-BD9159206068AEC6'[[package]]
      name = 'std'
      source =
        'git+https://github.com/fuellabs/sway?tag=v0.46.1#512a3386f8961185188302f391ccc96553d23a7a'
      dependencies = ['core']
      ```

   4. Add the file **`Forc.toml`**:

      ```tsx
      ;[project]
      authors = ['FuelLabs']
      entry = 'main.sw'
      license = 'Apache-2.0'
      name = 'MyContract'[dependencies]
      ```

   5. To set up the contract deployment on the network, add a file to the root of the project named **`fuels.config.ts`**:

      ```tsx
      import { createConfig } from 'fuels'

      export default createConfig({
        providerUrl: 'https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql',
        output: './src/contracts/',
        contracts: ['./sway'],
        privateKey: <YOUR_PK />,
      })
      ```

   6. At the root of the project, run the command **`yarn fuels build`**, and the folder **`src/contracts`** will be generated containing the build of our contract.

      ```tsx
      yarn fuels build
      ```

   7. Deploy the contract to the network by executing the command **`yarn fuels deploy`**.

      ```tsx
      yarn fuels deploy
      ```

   8. Now we have our contract on the network, and we can interact with it through our DApp:

      ```tsx
      import { MyContractAbi__factory } from './contracts/contracts/factories/MyContractAbi__factory'
      import contractIds from './contracts/contract-ids.json'

      async function handleContractCall() {
        if (!account) return
        const provider = await FuelWalletProvider.create(BSafe.get('PROVIDER'))
        const wallet = await fuel.getWallet(account, provider)
        const contract = MyContractAbi__factory.connect(contractIds.myContract, wallet)

        const { value, transactionId } = await contract.functions
          .return_true(10)
          .txParams({
            gasPrice: bn(BSafe.get('GAS_PRICE')),
            gasLimit: bn(BSafe.get('GAS_LIMIT')),
          })
          .call()
      }
      ```

   9. Now you have your application connected. Vault subscribers in the Bako Safe app also receive a notification requesting their signature.
