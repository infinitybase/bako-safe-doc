## Creating a Transaction
- To create a transaction from a dApp, follow these steps:
- Connect to the dApp using one of your accounts by utilizing one of our authentication methods (Fuel Wallet, Fuellet, or WebAuthn).
- Select one of your vaults to connect with the dApp. Upon confirming your selection, the window will close.
- At this point, you will have access to the vault.
- Proceed to create a transfer, sending a specified amount to a certain account.
- A BSafe window will open, asking you to confirm the creation of the transaction.
- Following this, visit the website https://safe.bako.global/home and sign the transaction.
- Once all the necessary signatures have been collected, the transaction will be automatically sent.
- The dApp will be notified upon the successful completion of the transaction.

This process ensures a secure and efficient way to interact with decentralized applications, providing users with full control over their transactions and assets.

## Calling a Contract
To invoke a contract from a BSafe vault via another app:

- Connect to the dApp using one of your accounts by utilizing one of our authentication methods (Fuel Wallet, Fuellet, or WebAuthn).
- Select one of your vaults to connect with the dApp. Upon confirming your selection, the window will close.
- Now that you have access to the vault:
    - Create a transaction and insert a script to call the desired contract (in this example, we're calling a contract that simply returns the value 10).
- A BSafe window will open, asking you to confirm the creation of the transaction.
- Following this, visit the website https://safe.bako.global/home and sign the created transaction.
- Once all the necessary signatures have been collected, the script will be executed automatically.
- The dApp will be notified upon the successful completion of the transaction.

This process allows for secure and efficient contract invocation through BSafe vaults, offering users the ability to interact with smart contracts directly from another application.
