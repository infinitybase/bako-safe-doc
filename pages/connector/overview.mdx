# Bako Safe Connector

The Bako Safe Connector enables external dApps to interact with the Bako Safe ecosystem through the Fuel wallet infrastructure.

## What is it?

The connector provides a secure interface for:

- **User Authentication**: Connect users to their Bako Safe vaults
- **Asset Management**: View and manage vault balances
- **Transaction Safety**: Multi-signature transaction approval flow
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing Fuel wallet connector infrastructure

## How it Works

## Key Features

### Multi-Signature Support

Transactions created through the connector require approval from vault signers before execution.

### Vault Selection

Users can select which vault to use when connecting, allowing management of multiple vaults.

### Transaction Queue

Pending transactions are queued in Bako Safe until all required signatures are collected.

### Notification System

Vault signers receive notifications when transactions require their approval.

## Architecture

The connector integrates with:

- **Fuel Wallet SDK**: Standard wallet connection interface
- **Bako Safe App**: Vault management and transaction approval
- **Bako Safe SDK**: Backend communication and transaction handling

## Use Cases

### DeFi Applications

Allow users to interact with DeFi protocols using their multi-sig vaults for enhanced security.

### DAO Treasury Management
