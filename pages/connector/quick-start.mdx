## Building a DApp to interact with the Bako Safe connector



To create your dapp, you can use as a basis the code from the [example application](https://github.com/infinitybase/bsafe-dapp) that was previously presented.<br/>


To create a dApp that interacts with Bako Safe, you'll need beforehand:

- **[Fuel wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fuel-wallet/dldjpboieedgcmpkchcjcbijingjcgok) installed in your browser**
- **An account and a vault created in the [Bako Safe](https://safe.bako.global/)**

### 1. Cloning the project and installing dependencies

We'll be using a React template with TypeScript and Chakra UI. Simply clone the repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/infinitybase/bsafe-dapp.git
```

Now we'll install the necessary dependencies to run the project, including:

- @fuels: the fuels SDK for TypeScript
- @bsafe: the Bako Safe SDK for interacting with resources
- @fuel-wallet/react: the fuels wallet for React

```bash
    cd bsafe-dapp &&
    yarn &&
```

### 2. Understanding our project

In the file `src/App.tsx` we add the Fuels provider with Bako Safe connector.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App.tsx";
import { FuelProvider } from "@fuel-wallet/react";
import { BSafeConnector } from "bsafe";
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { defaultTheme } from "./themes/default.ts";

const bsafe = new BSafeConnector();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <FuelProvider
      theme={"dark"}
      fuelConfig={{
        connectors: [bsafe],
        storage: null,
      }}
    >
      <ChakraProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
        <App />
      </ChakraProvider>
    </FuelProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

By adding the Fuel provider around our application, we gain access to some hooks to interact with the fuel wallet:

```tsx
const { fuel } = useFuel();
const { account } = useAccount();
const { disconnect } = useDisconnect();
const { isConnected } = useIsConnected();
const { isOpen, onOpen, onClose } = useDisclosure();
```

Besides the hooks from the example, there are several more useful ones you can check via the [link](https://fuels-wallet-erxr68joe-fuel-labs.vercel.app/docs/dev/getting-started/)

### 3. Creating a Transaction

When the user connects to the fuel wallet, they choose a predicate previously created in the Bako Safe app,
and from there, the user can create transactions for that predicate and send them:

```tsx
async function handleTransfer() {
  if (!account) return;
  const amount = bn.parseUnits(amountInput) ?? bn(1_000);

  const provider = await FuelWalletProvider.create(
    BSafe.get('PROVIDER')
  );

  const wallet = await fuel.getWallet(account, provider);

  const result = await wallet.transfer(
    Address.fromString(addressInput),
    amount,
    BaseAssetId,
    {
      gasPrice: BSafe.get('GAS_PRICE'),
      gasLimit: BSafe.get('GAS_LIMIT'),
    }
  );

  const { id, status } = await result.waitForResult();
  console.log("result: ", { id, status });
}
```

When sending the transaction, it isn't immediately broadcasted to the network. Instead, it's sent to the Bako Safe servers and waits for the vault subscribers who generated the transaction to sign it. Once all signature requirements are met, the transaction is broadcasted to the network.

### 4. Calling a Contract

The contract call works similarly to a transaction we simply use the vault again as a wallet and, having access to the contract's ABI generated earlier, we can call the contract's methods:

Initially, let's create a simple contract to interact with Bako Safe. To do this, create a folder called `sway`, Inside it, create a file `src/main.sw`:

```sw
contract;

use std::logging::log;

abi MyContract {
    fn return_true(val1: u64) -> u64;
}

impl MyContract for Contract {
    fn return_true(val1: u64) -> u64 {
        log(val1);
        val1
    }
}
```

Add file `Forc.lock`:

```sw
[[package]]
name = "MyContract"
source = "member"
dependencies = ["std"]

[[package]]
name = "core"
source = "path+from-root-BD9159206068AEC6"

[[package]]
name = "std"
source = "git+https://github.com/fuellabs/sway?tag=v0.46.1#512a3386f8961185188302f391ccc96553d23a7a"
dependencies = ["core"]

```

Add file `Forc.toml`

```sw
[project]
authors = ["FuelLabs"]
entry = "main.sw"
license = "Apache-2.0"
name = "MyContract"

[dependencies]

```

Add a file to the root of the project named `fuels.config.ts` to set up the contract deployment on the network, use the following content:

```tsx
import { createConfig } from "fuels";

export default createConfig({
  providerUrl: "https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql",
  output: "./src/contracts/",
  contracts: ["./sway"],
  privateKey: <YOUR_PK />,
});
```

At the root of the project, run the command, and the folder `src/contracts` will be generated containing the build of our contract.

```bash
    yarn fuels build
```

After this, simply deploy the contract to the network by executing the command:

```bash
    yarn fuels deploy
```

Now we have our contract on the network, and we can interact with it through our DApp.

```tsx
import { MyContractAbi__factory } from "./contracts/contracts/factories/MyContractAbi__factory";
import contractIds from "./contracts/contract-ids.json";

async function handleContractCall() {
  if (!account) return;
  const provider = await FuelWalletProvider.create(
    BSafe.get('PROVIDER')
  );
  const wallet = await fuel.getWallet(account, provider);
  const contract = MyContractAbi__factory.connect(
    contractIds.myContract,
    wallet
  );

  const { value, transactionId } = await contract.functions
    .return_true(10)
    .txParams({
      gasPrice: bn(BSafe.get('GAS_PRICE')),
      gasLimit: bn(BSafe.get('GAS_LIMIT')),
    })
    .call();
}
```

In the Bako Safe app, the vault subscribers will also receive a notification, requesting their signature.
