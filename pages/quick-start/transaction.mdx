# Transaction

After creating your Vault instance and sending balance to it, you can interact with it by creating transactions and sending them to Fuel accounts.

## Instance transfer

To create an instance of a transfer, you need your Vault instance, execute the `vault.includeTransaction()`
method passing `ITransferAsset[]` with the following properties:

| Prop    |            Description             |  Value |      Example |
|:--------|:----------------------------------:|-------:|-------------:|
| amount  |  Quantity of asset in transaction  | string |       0.0001 |
| assetId |            Id of asset             | string |   0x00000... |
| to      | Address of you transfer this asset | string | fuel1flop... |

```ts
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = new Vault({
    configurable: {
        network: 'FUEL_NETWORK',
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: ['FUEL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'],
        HASH_PREDUCATE: undefined,
    }
});

const transfer = vault.includeTransaction([
    {
        amount: bn(1_000).format(),
        assetId: 'ASSET_ID',
        to: 'FUEL_ADDRESS'
    }
], []);

console.log(tranfer);
```
## Sign transfer

To execute the transfers it is necessary to sign it, through the fuel wallet it is possible to sign the message with the
transaction hash using the method `wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId())` and adding this signature to the
transaction through from the `transfer.transaction.witnesses` property.

```ts
const transfer = vault.includeTransaction([
    {
        amount: bn(1_000).format(),
        assetId: 'ASSET_ID',
        to: 'FUEL_ADDRESS'
    }
], []);

const wallet = await fuel.getWallet('FUEL CURRENT ACCOUNT');
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId());

transfer.transaction.witnesses = [signature];

console.log(transfer.transaction.witnesses);
```

## Send transaction

After having all the necessary signatures, it is possible to execute your transaction using the `transfer.transaction.sendTransaction()` method,
it will execute the transfer within the chain, going through all Vault validation and returning the result with the following response:

| Prop    |              Description              |                  Value |
|:--------|:-------------------------------------:|-----------------------:|
| status  |         Status of transaction         | "success" or "failure" |
| block   | Link of transaction in Block Explorer |                 string |
| gasUsed |   Amount of gas used in transaction   |                 string |

```ts
const transfer = vault.includeTransaction([
    {
        amount: bn(1_000).format(),
        assetId: 'ASSET_ID',
        to: 'FUEL_ADDRESS'
    }
], []);

// Set all signatures and check if all account signed

const transactionResponse = await transfer.transaction.sendTransaction();

console.log(transactionResponse)
```

import {SendTransaction} from "../../components/transaction/send";

<SendTransaction/>
