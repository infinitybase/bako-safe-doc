# Transaction

After creating your Vault instance and sending balance to it, you can interact with it by creating transactions and sending them to Fuel accounts.

## Create

To create an instance of a transfer, you need your Vault instance, execute the `vault.BSAFEIncludeTransaction()`
method passing `ITransferAsset[]` in `asset` prop with the following properties:

| Prop    |            Description             |  Value |      Example |
|:--------|:----------------------------------:|-------:|-------------:|
| amount  |  Quantity of asset in transaction  | string |       0.0001 |
| assetId |            Id of asset             | string |   0x00000... |
| to      | Address of you transfer this asset | string | fuel1flop... |

```ts copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = await Vault.create();

const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEIncludeTransaction({
    name: 'Transaction One',
    assets: [{
        amount: bn(1_000).format(),
        assetId: 'ASSET_ID',
        to: 'FUEL_ADDRESS'
    }],
    witnesses: [], // Not required
});

console.log(tranfer);
```

If the vault is authenticated, it is possible to access the information stored in it.

```ts copy
console.log(tranfer.BSAFEScript);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransaction);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Get transaction

Authentication is necessary to access a transaction by ID.

```ts copy
const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);

console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Get all transactions

Authentication is necessary to get all transactions.

```ts copy
const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransactions({
  status: TransactionStatus.PENDING_SENDER
});

console.log(tranfer.BSAFEScript);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransaction);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Send transaction

```ts copy
const transfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);
await transfer.send()
```

## Wait

```ts copy
const transfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);
await transfer.wait()
```

## Sign transfer

To execute the transfers it is necessary to sign it, through the fuel wallet it is possible to sign the message with the
transaction hash using the method `wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId())`.

```ts
const transfer = vault.BSAFEincludeTransaction();
const wallet = await fuel.getWallet('FUEL CURRENT ACCOUNT');
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId());

transfer.witnesses = [signature];
```
