# Vault methods

## Address
When instantiating your Vault, it is possible to get the address of
your Vault with the following property `vault.address`

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = await Vault.create();
console.log(vault.address); // fuel1123klajsdh....
```

## Balance
With your Vault instance, you can search for the balance in ETH with the following method `vault.getBalance()`
this method will return a [BN](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/), to convert in string execute `balance.format()`

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = await Vault.create();
const balance = await vault.getBalance();

console.log(balance.format()); // Result: 0.0000000
```

## Assets
To search for all Assets in your predicate, run the `vault.getBalances()` method.
This method will return a list of CoinQuantities with the following properties:
- amount: value of your Asset in BN
- assetId: identifier of your asset "0x000...."

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = await Vault.create();
const assets = await vault.getBalances();

console.log(assets); // CoinQuantity[]
```
