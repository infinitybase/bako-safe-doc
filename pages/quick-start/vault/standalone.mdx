# Standalone

Allows you to manage your vault

## Create vault
To create a Vault instance you need to set the Configurable with the following parameters:

- **configurable.network**: url of Fuel Network, in this versions is working with (beta-4)
- **configurable.SIGNATURES_COUNT**: length of required signatures
- **configurable.SIGNERS**: all addresses included in the Vault
- **configurable.chainId**: id of the chain of your provider
- **provider**: provider to connect a node

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');
const vaultPayload = {
    configurable: {
      network: provider.url,
      chainId: provider.getChainId(),
      SIGNERS: ['ADDRESS_1', 'ADDRESS_2'],
      SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
      HASH_PREDICATE: [1, 2], // This param is not required
    },
    provider: provider,
}

await Vault.create(vaultPayload)
```

<Callout type="info">
    In this example enables to create a vault with 2 signers but 1 signature is required to approve the transaction.
    If more required signers you can change the prop **configurable.SIGNATURES_COUNT** for max of signers.
</Callout>

## Instance vault by payload

It's possible get an instance of you vault by your payload used in creation of vault setting the same value in used in configurable.

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');
const vaultPayload = {
    configurable: {
      network: provider.url,
      chainId: provider.getChainId(),
      SIGNERS: ['ADDRESS_1', 'ADDRESS_2'],
      SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
      HASH_PREDICATE: [1, 2],
    },
    provider: provider,
}

// Create vault
const vault = await Vault.create(vaultPayload);

// Get the same instance
const sameVaultInstance = await Vault.create(vaultPayload);
```

## Next step

Now with your Vault created and its instance you can interact with it, follow the link to check all available method's.
