# Vault

Our Vault extends all the features of Fuel Predicate, below we will explain how to generate an instance and manipulate your vault.

import {Callout} from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
    In this steps we will recommend install [Fuel Wallet (Chrome extensions)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fuel-wallet/dldjpboieedgcmpkchcjcbijingjcgok?hl=pt-br) to interact with our doc.

## Create
To create a Vault instance you need to pass the Configurables with the following parameters:

- **network**: url of Fuel Network, in this versions is working with (beta-3)
- **SIGNATURES_COUNT**: length of required signatures
- **SIGNERS**: all addresses included in the Vault
- **HASH_PREDUCATE**: hash to instantiate an existing Vault

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

new Vault({
    configurable: {
        network: 'FUEL_NETWORK',
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: ['FUEL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'],
        HASH_PREDUCATE: undefined,
    }
})
```

## Address
When instantiating your Vault, it is possible to get the address of
your Vault with the following property `vault.address`

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = new Vault({
    configurable: {
        network: 'FUEL_NETWORK',
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: ['FUEL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'],
        HASH_PREDUCATE: undefined,
    }
});

console.log(vault.address); // fuel1123klajsdh....
```

import {VaultAddress} from "../../components";

<VaultAddress />

## Balance
With your Vault instance, you can search for the balance in ETH with the following method `vault.getBalance()`
this method will return a [BN](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/), to convert in string execute `balance.format()`

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = new Vault({
    configurable: {
        network: 'FUEL_NETWORK',
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: ['FUEL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'],
        HASH_PREDUCATE: undefined,
    }
});

const balance = await vault.getBalance();

console.log(balance.format()); // Result: 0.0000000
```

import {VaultBalance} from "../../components";

<VaultBalance />

## Assets
To search for all Assets in your predicate, run the `vault.getBalances()` method.
This method will return a list of CoinQuantities with the following properties:
- amount: value of your Asset in BN
- assetId: identifier of your asset "0x000...."

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = new Vault({
    configurable: {
        network: 'FUEL_NETWORK',
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: ['FUEL_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS'],
        HASH_PREDUCATE: undefined,
    }
});

const assets = await vault.getBalances();

console.log(assets); // CoinQuantity[]
```

import {VaultAssets} from "../../components";

<VaultAssets />
