## Authentication

Bako Safe provides an SDK to manage all the logic of a Multisig Wallet. This can be used in two different
ways: `Standalone` or as part of the `Bako Safe Ecosystem`.

To utilize the `Bako Safe Ecosystem`, authentication is required. With authentication, it's possible to use several methods, such as:
- Waiting for all signatures of a transaction before sending it
- Creating a Vault and managing it through our [app](https://safe.bako.global/)
- Using our [app](https://safe.bako.global/) to manage transactions
- Creating your Vaults and using them in other applications through our Wallet Connector

## Authentication by Fuel Wallet
In order to authenticate using a Fuel Wallet, follow these steps:

```ts
import { Auth, TypeUser, IAuthCreateRequest, BakoSafe } from "bakosafe"

const params: IAuthCreateRequest = {
    address: <YOUR_FUEL_WALLET_ADDRESS/>, // fuels..dsai
    provider: BakoSafe.getProviders('PROVIDER'), // https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql for example
    type: TypeUser.FUEL, // TypeUser.FUEL
};

const auth = await Auth.create(params);
//sign auth code using your fuel wallet, to create your session
await auth.signerByAccount(wallet);

//use your BakoSafeAuth on Auth to instance other services on BakoSafe
console.log(auth.BakoSafeAuth);

```

In this code snippet, `Auth.create` method is used to create a new instance of the Auth.
It requires the wallet address (`fuels..dsai`) and the Provider URL (`https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql`).
You need to specify the type of user as `TypeUser.FUEL`.
After this, sign your `Auth.code` using your Fuel Wallet, and send your signature using auth.signerByAccount() to create your session.

## Authentication by Private Key
You can also authenticate by using a Private Key as follows:
```ts
import { Auth, TypeUser, IAuthCreateRequest, BakoSafe } from "bakosafe"

const YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY = <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>;
const YOUR_ADDRESS = <YOUR_ADDRESS>;

const params: IAuthCreateRequest = {
    address: YOUR_ADDRESS, // fuels..dsai
    provider: BakoSafe.getProviders('PROVIDER'), // https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql for example
    type: TypeUser.FUEL, // TypeUser.FUEL
};
const auth = await Auth.create(params);

//sign auth code using your PK
const sig = await Auth.signerByPk(YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, auth.code);
await auth.signerByAccount(sig);

//use your BakoSafeAuth on Auth to instance other services on BakoSafe
console.log(auth.BakoSafeAuth);
```

In this code snippet, `Auth.create` method is used to create a new instance of the Auth.
It requires the wallet address (`YOUR_ADDRESS`), the Provider URL (`https://beta-5.fuel.network/graphql`) and the private key of account (`YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`).
You need to specify the type of user as `TypeUser.FUEL`.

Then, the `signerByPk` method is used to sign in using the provided Private Key for the
authentication process.
