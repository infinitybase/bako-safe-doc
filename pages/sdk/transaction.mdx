# Transaction

Once you've set up your Vault and transferred funds to it, you can handle transactions, including creating them, transferring assets,
signing the transactions, and then waiting for the signatures before they can be dispatched to the chain.

## Create

To instantiate a transfer, a Vault instance is required. This is followed by the execution of the
`vault.BSAFEIncludeTransaction()` method. This method takes as input an `ITransferAsset[]` array passed to the `asset` property,
encapsulating the following properties:

| Prop    |            Description             |  Value |      Example |
|:--------|:----------------------------------:|-------:|-------------:|
| amount  |  Quantity of asset in transaction  | string |       0.0001 |
| assetId |            Id of asset             | string |   0x00000... |
| to      | Address of you transfer this asset | string | fuel1flop... |

```ts copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";

const vault = await Vault.create();

const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEIncludeTransaction({
    name: 'Transaction One',
    assets: [{
        amount: bn(1_000).format(),
        assetId: 'ASSET_ID',
        to: 'FUEL_ADDRESS'
    }],
    witnesses: [], // Not required
});
```

A transaction can also be created using a `TransactionRequestLike`:

```ts copy
import { ScriptTransactionRequest } from "@fuel-ts/providers";

// Example executing a Script Transaction
const transactionRequest = ScriptTransactionRequest.from({});

const vault = await Vault.create();
const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEIncludeTransaction(transactionRequest);
```

or an authenticated Vault instance, the BSafe information can be retrieved using these properties:

```ts copy
console.log(tranfer.BSAFEScript);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransaction);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Get transaction

Authentication is necessary to access a transaction by ID.

```ts copy
const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);

console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Get all transactions

Authentication is necessary to get all transactions.

```ts copy
const tranfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransactions({
  status: TransactionStatus.PENDING_SENDER
});

console.log(tranfer.BSAFEScript);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransaction);
console.log(tranfer.BSAFETransactionId);
```

## Send transaction

```ts copy
const transfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);
await transfer.send()
```

## Wait

Upon authentication, you can wait for transaction confirmation with BSafe:

```ts copy
const transfer = await vault.BSAFEGetTransaction(transactionId);
await transfer.wait()
```

## Sign transfer

To execute the transfers it is necessary to sign it, through the fuel wallet it is possible to sign the message with the
transaction hash using the method `wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId())`.

```ts
const transfer = vault.BSAFEincludeTransaction();
const wallet = await fuel.getWallet('FUEL CURRENT ACCOUNT');
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(transfer.transaction.getHashTxId());

transfer.sign(signature)
```
