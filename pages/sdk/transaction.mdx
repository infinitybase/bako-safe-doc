## Transaction

Once you've set up your Vault and transferred funds to it, you can handle transactions, 
including creating them, transferring assets, signing the transactions, 
and then waiting for the signatures before they can be dispatched to the chain.


### Create a transaction

Send assets to your vault using [Fuels' faucet](https://faucet-beta-5.fuel.network/) 
so that we can proceed with the implementation of a transaction.
<br/>
You can sign your transaction using a private key or using the [Fuel wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fuel-wallet/dldjpboieedgcmpkchcjcbijingjcgok) through the browser.

```ts
import { Auth, TypeUser, IAuthCreateRequest, BakoSafe } from "bakosafe"
import { NativeAssetId } from 'fuels'


const YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY = <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>;
const YOUR_ADDRESS = <YOUR_ADDRESS>;

// create your vault implementation
const params: IPayloadVault = {
    name: "My First Vault",
    description: "This is my first example of a Vault",
    configurable: {
        SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
        SIGNERS: [
            YOUR_ADDRESS,
            Address.fromRandom().toString(),
        ],
        network: BakoSafe.getProviders('CHAIN_URL')
    }
}
const vault = await Vault.create(VaultPayload);


const vault = Vault.create(params);
const params: IFormatTransfer = {
    name: 'My transaction example name',
    assets: [
        {
            assetId: NativeAssetId,
            amounte: '0.0019',
            to: Address.random().toString()
        }
    ]
}

const tx = await vault.BakoSafeIncludeTransaction(params);

const signature = await Auth.signerByPk(YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, tx.getHashTxId());

tx.witnesses = [
    signature
]

// Send transaction
tx.send()
const result = await tx.wait();

```

You can check the result on the [Fuel block explorer](https://app.fuel.network/) by searching for the return of the `tx.getHashTxId()` method.
