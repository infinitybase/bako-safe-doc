# Authentication

```ts
import { AuthService } from "bsafe";
```

Bako Safe provides an SDK to manage all the logic of a Multisig Wallet. This can be used in two different
ways: `Standalone` or as part of the `Bako Safe Ecosystem`.

To utilize the `Bako Safe Ecosystem`, authentication is required. With authentication, it's possible to use several methods, such as:
- Waiting for all signatures of a transaction before sending it
- Creating a Vault and managing it through our [app](https://app.bsafe.pro/)
- Using our [app](https://app.bsafe.pro/) to manage transactions
- Creating your Vaults and using them in other applications through our Wallet Connector

## Authentication via a Fuel Wallet
In order to authenticate using a Fuel Wallet, follow these steps:

```ts
const authService = await AuthService.create('ADDRESS', provider.url);
await authService.signerByAccount(wallet);
await authService.createSession();
```

In this code snippet, `AuthService.create` method is used to create a new instance of the AuthService.
It requires the wallet address (`'ADDRESS'`) and the Provider URL (`provider.url`).
The `signerByAccount` method signs in using the provided wallet for the authentication process.

## Authentication via a Private Key
You can also authenticate by using a Private Key as follows:
```ts
const authService = await AuthService.create('ADDRESS', provider.url);
await authService.signerByPk('ACCOUNT_PK');
await authService.createSession();
```

In this example, `AuthService.create` launches a new instance of the AuthService requiring the
wallet address (`'ADDRESS'`) and the provider URL (`provider.url`).

Then, the `signerByPk` method is used to sign in using the provided Private Key for the
authentication process.

## Signing a Transaction
You can sign a transaction using the following method:
```ts
const authService = await AuthService.create('ADDRESS', provider.url);
await authService.signTransaction(wallet, BSAFETransactionID);
await authService.createSession();
```

In this code snippet, `AuthService.create` is used to establish a new instance of the AuthService.
It takes in the wallet address (`'ADDRESS'`) and the provider URL (`provider.url`).

Then, the `signTransaction` method is used for signing a transaction using the given wallet and transaction ID
(`'BSAFETransactionID'`).
