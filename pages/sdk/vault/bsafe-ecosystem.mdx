# Bako Safe ecosystem

This feature allows you to create and manage your Vault within the Bako Safe.

<Callout type="warning">
    Please note that authentication is mandatory to integrate with the Bako Safe Ecosystem. We've provided a method to
    initiate a session. Explore more in our [Authentication Documentation](../authentication).
</Callout>

## Create

The process of creating a Vault within the Bako Safe Ecosystem is similar to the standalone method, but you need to
provide the **BSAFEAuth** property in this case.

```tsx copy
import {AuthService, Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const wallet = await fuel.getWallet('ADDRESS');
const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');

/* Authentication in BSafe */
const authService = await AuthService.create('ADDRESS', provider.url);
await authService.signerByAccount(wallet);
const auth = await authService.createSession();

const vaultPayload = {
    configurable: {
      network: provider.url,
      chainId: provider.getChainId(),
      SIGNERS: ['ADDRESS_1', 'ADDRESS_2'],
      SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
      HASH_PREDICATE: [1, 2],
    },
    provider: provider,
    BSAFEAuth: auth,
}

// Create vault
const vault = await Vault.create(vaultPayload);
console.log(vault.BSAFEVaultId);
```

Upon successful creation of your Vault within the Ecosystem, you can access the following properties in the Vault instance:
- **BSAFEVaultId**: An identifier for the Vault in our Ecosystem
- **BSAFEVault**: Data related to the Vault in our Ecosystem

## Get Vault

```ts copy
import {AuthService, Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const wallet = await fuel.getWallet('ADDRESS');
const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');

/* Authentication in Bako Safe */
const authService = await AuthService.create('ADDRESS', provider.url);
await authService.signerByAccount(wallet);
const auth = await authService.createSession();

// By Bako Safe id
const vault = await Vault.create('VAULT_ID');
console.log(vault.BSAFEVaultId);

```

## Next step

Now with your Vault created in our ecosystem you can interact with it, follow the link to check all available method's.
