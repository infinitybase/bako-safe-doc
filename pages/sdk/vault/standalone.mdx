# Standalone

The Standalone mode gives you the freedom to administer your vault independently.

## Create vault
To create a Vault instance you need to set the Configurable with the following parameters:

- **configurable.network**: url of Fuel Network.
- **configurable.SIGNATURES_COUNT**: length of required signatures
- **configurable.SIGNERS**: all addresses included in the Vault
- **configurable.chainId**: id of the chain of your provider
- **provider**: provider to connect a node

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');
const vaultPayload = {
    configurable: {
      network: provider.url,
      chainId: provider.getChainId(),
      SIGNERS: ['ADDRESS_1', 'ADDRESS_2'],
      SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
      HASH_PREDICATE: [1, 2], // This param is not required
    },
    provider: provider,
}

await Vault.create(vaultPayload)
```

<Callout type="info">
    This example illustrates the creation of a vault with 2 signers, where only 1 signature is required to approve the
    transaction. If more signers are needed, you can adjust the prop **configurable.SIGNATURES_COUNT** accordingly.
</Callout>

## Instance vault by payload

You can retrieve an instance of your Vault using the payload employed during the vault creation.
Just set the same value in the configurable.

```tsx copy
import {Vault} from "bsafe";
import {Provider} from "@fuel-ts/providers";

const provider = await Provider.create('PROVIDER_URL');
const vaultPayload = {
    configurable: {
      network: provider.url,
      chainId: provider.getChainId(),
      SIGNERS: ['ADDRESS_1', 'ADDRESS_2'],
      SIGNATURES_COUNT: 1,
      HASH_PREDICATE: [1, 2],
    },
    provider: provider,
}

// Create vault
const vault = await Vault.create(vaultPayload);

// Get the same instance
const sameVaultInstance = await Vault.create(vaultPayload);
```

## Next step

Now with your Vault created and its instance you can interact with it, follow the link to check all available methods.
