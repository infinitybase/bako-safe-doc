# Vault

In the context of web3 applications and blockchain, a **Vault** is a secure storage used for managing and protecting crypto assets. It often includes features such as multi-signature approvals and time delays for transactions.

On the other hand, a **Fuel Predicate** is a smart contract that defines a certain type of transaction. In Fuel, an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain, these predicates handle different types of operations securely and efficiently. Essentially, they dictate how a transaction or operation is processed in the system.

Our Vault extends all the features of the Fuel Predicate. The following sections will provide details on how to generate a Vault instance and manage it.

Bako Safe offers two ways of managing a Vault: **Standalone** and by using the **Bako Safe Ecosystem**.

- **Standalone**: This implies that the application or system is able to function independently. In the case of Bako Safe, using it in a standalone mode refers to managing the Multisig Wallet or the Vault on your own.

- **Bako Safe Ecosystem**: This platform enables seamless management of your Vault within our [app](https://app.bsafe.pro).
You can view signatories, transactions, and balances, etc... and allows to use your Vault in other DApps via Wallet Connector.
