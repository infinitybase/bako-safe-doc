# Intro

Bako Safe is a multi signature wallet platform built on Fuel Network,  an operating system purpose-built for Ethereum rollups, designed to help developers build decentralized economies at scale.
<br/>
Through our SDK, you can create vaults and register the signers, set the approval rule, and create and sign transfers.
Here we introduce you how integrate with the [Bako Safe SDK](./sdk/installation) and the [Bako Safe CONNECTOR](./connector/what) to benefit from the security and flexibility of a multisig environment on your DApps.
