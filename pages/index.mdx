# Introduction

Here we introduce you how integrate with the [BSAFE SDK](./sdk/installation) and the [BSAFE CONNECTOR](./connector/a) to benefit from the security and flexibility of a multisig environment on your DApps.

## What is BSAFE?

BSAFE is a multisig platform where you can create your vault with customized rules for your transactions.

Currently our SDK allows you to register 1 or more addresses in your vault where it is mandatory to sign all addresses to execute the transaction.
